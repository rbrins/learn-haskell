# Starting out with Learn You a Haskell for Great Good
I'm using learnyouahaskell.com as my primary kickoff source of knowledge. 

Going through the tutorial and book put out there feels very much like any time I learn a new language (or at least get familiar with one). 

Some confusing ramblings coming from imperative languages:
* for loops are non-existent 
* since data is immutable `a = 1` and `let a = 1` seem to be the same thing as far as definitions go and I'm not sure when you would want to use one over the other
* using some basic recursion I was able to get to the `' '` character and return something, but then adding this returned something up and continuing to go through the line did not happen in the first few hours of going through the tutorial.
