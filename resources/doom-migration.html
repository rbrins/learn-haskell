<h2 id="1"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> First Impressions</h2>
<p>
Started with a clean install since my <code>.emacs</code> file from windows wasn&rsquo;t working right and I was tired of fighting it.
In my normal workflow of typing in org files I&rsquo;ve noticed that it does something that I would have preferred out of the box with emacs on windows (and eventually tried to do in one way or another).
</p>
<ol>
<li>auto-indentation doesn&rsquo;t suck</li>
<li>Spellcheck works and offers auto-completions which is NICE</li>
<li>when I created a new org file, it pasted the <code>#+title</code> in the first line for me. (note to self, find this and add more to it)</li>

</ol>

<h2 id="2"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Config Files</h2>
<p>
From the main page of doom emacs
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You can configure Doom by tweaking the files found in your DOOMDIR. Doom expects this directory to be found in one of:
</p>

<p>
~/.config/doom (respects $XDG<sub>CONFIG</sub><sub>HOME</sub>)
or ~/.doom.d
</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="slide-2-1">
<h3 id="2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> doom config files</h3>
<p>
if we look in the <code>~/.doom.d</code> we find the trifecta of doom config files.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-shell"><span style="color: #ECBE7B;">ls</span> ~/.doom.d
<span style="color: #ECBE7B;">ls</span> ~/.config/doom
</pre>
</div>
<p>
config.el
init.el
packages.el
</p>

<p>
ls: cannot access &rsquo;<i>home/rbrins</i>.config/doom&rsquo;: No such file or directory
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-2-2">
<h3 id="2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> or ~/.config files</h3>
<p>
I&rsquo;ll use the <code>~/.doom.d</code> directory for now but eventually want to start storing my config files in <code>~/.config/</code> as I get more use to linux as my daily driver.
Either way, according to the config information page, <code>init.el</code> is for modules, <code>config.el</code> is for the private customization, and <code>packages.el</code> is for installing the packages. It explicitly mentions not using the <code>customize</code> in default which is nice considering I was fighting that so often.

<h2 id="3"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Preconfigured Canvas</h2>
<p>
I saw a reddit comment that mentioned that vanilla emacs was a blank canvas, spacemacs was the canvas painted by the community and ever growing, and doom emacs was a canvas with a little started on the canvas and currated tools. This is very apt for what I&rsquo;ve seen from doom so far and enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
This has helped me adopt org-agenda and org-roam much faster than I was adopting before since it has the bindings and auto-completion already existing for these packages.
