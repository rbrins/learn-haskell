    Brief scan of projects & project clean up

<h1 id="brief-project-prioritization-clean-up">Brief Project Prioritization &amp; Clean Up</h1>
<p>Today I’m looking back at the previous 3 days, what I’ve setout to do, what I’ve added or clarified to my list, and to clean up some things.</p>
<h2 id="previous-3-days">Previous 3 Days</h2>
<p>I’ve installed Haskell, Hakyll, and started learning the language. Hakyll is set up with github pages in a very basic, barely functioning state. Haskell knowledge is progressing and I’ve completed a few different tutorials.</p>
<h2 id="goal-progress">Goal Progress</h2>
<p>From my first blog on day 1:
1. Learning more about the functional programming paradigm - From Day 2 (and really everyday) I’m continuing to learn more about the paradigm and applying it specifically to my own style of imperative programming I’ve learned.
2. Xmonad tiling windows manager - Have not began this but wanted to drop the link for future Russell’s reference - <a href="https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html">https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html</a>
3. Better at literate programming - really vague and sounds like a value goal instead of a goal outcome. To clarify a bit more, I’d like for my personal config files to be in a literate programming format and that compiles to my dot config files.
4. Offensive security applications - I have no idea what is possible here yet, the first application that comes to mind would be a dropper but sounds like Future Russell’s problem</p>
<h2 id="clean-up">Clean Up</h2>
<p>The blog is rough and that is what I’m going to focus on today, trying to get under the hood of hakyll enough to make the apperance, less rough.</p>
